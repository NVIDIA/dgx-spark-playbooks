This module provides mock weather tools that return humorous, fake responses rather than real 
weather data.

Features:
    - Mock weather data retreival for any location
    - Example implementation of MCP tool registration with local functions
    - Demonstration of FastMCP server setup

Tools provided:
    - get_weather(location): Returns mock weather information
    - get_rain_forecast(location): Returns mock rain forecast data

Usage:
  - Usage in Chatbot Spark:
    The server is ran on project startup by MCPClient. SEe client.py for more details
  - Standalone Usage:
    Run as standalone script to start the MCP server:
    $ python weather_test.py
