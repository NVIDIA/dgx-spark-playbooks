## Overview

## Basic idea

Open WebUI is an extensible, self-hosted AI interface that operates entirely offline.
This playbook shows you how to deploy Open WebUI with an integrated Ollama server on your DGX Spark device using
NVIDIA Sync. The setup creates a secure SSH tunnel that lets you access the web
interface from your local browser while the models run on Spark's GPU.

## What you'll accomplish

You will have a fully functional Open WebUI installation running on your DGX Spark, accessible through
your local web browser via NVIDIA Sync's managed SSH tunneling. The setup includes integrated Ollama
for model management, persistent data storage, and GPU acceleration for model inference.

## What to know before starting

- How to use NVIDIA Sync to connect to your DGX Spark device

## Prerequisites

-  DGX Spark device is set up and accessible
-  NVIDIA Sync installed and connected to your DGX Spark
-  Enough disk space for the Open WebUI container image and model downloads


## Time & risk

* **Duration**: 15-20 minutes for initial setup, plus model download time (varies by model size)
* **Risks**:
  * Docker permission issues may require user group changes and session restart
  * Large model downloads may take significant time depending on network speed

## Instructions

## Step 1. Configure Docker permissions

To easily manage containers without sudo, you must be in the `docker` group. If you choose to skip this step, you will need to run Docker commands with sudo.

Open a new terminal and test Docker access. In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

If you see a permission denied error (something like `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`), add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Test Docker access again. In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Step 2. Verify Docker setup and pull container

Pull the Open WebUI container image with integrated Ollama:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

## Step 3. Start the Open WebUI container

Start the Open WebUI container by running:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --gpus=all \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -v open-webui-ollama:/root/.ollama \
  --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

This will start the Open WebUI container and make it accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. You can access the Open WebUI interface from your local web browser.

Application data will be stored in the `open-webui` volume and model data will be stored in the `open-webui-ollama` volume.

## Step 4. Create administrator account

This step sets up the initial administrator account for Open WebUI. This is a local account that you will use to access the Open WebUI interface.

In the Open WebUI interface, click the "Get Started" button at the bottom of the screen.

Fill out the administrator account creation form with your preferred credentials.

Click the registration button to create your account and access the main interface.

## Step 5. Download and configure a model

This step downloads a language model through Ollama and configures it for use in
Open WebUI. The download happens on your DGX Spark device and may take several minutes.

Click on the "Select a model" dropdown in the top left corner of the Open WebUI interface.

Type `gpt-oss:20b` in the search field.

Click the "Pull 'gpt-oss:20b' from Ollama.com" button that appears.

Wait for the model download to complete. You can monitor progress in the interface.

Once complete, select "gpt-oss:20b" from the model dropdown.

## Step 6. Test the model

This step verifies that the complete setup is working properly by testing model
inference through the web interface.

In the chat textarea at the bottom of the Open WebUI interface, enter:

```
Write me a haiku about GPUs
```

Press Enter to send the message and wait for the model's response.

## Step 8. Cleanup and rollback

Steps to completely remove the Open WebUI installation and free up resources:

> [!WARNING]
> These commands will permanently delete all Open WebUI data and downloaded models.

Stop and remove the Open WebUI container:

```bash
docker stop open-webui
docker rm open-webui
```

Remove the downloaded images:

```bash
docker rmi ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

Remove persistent data volumes:

```bash
docker volume rm open-webui open-webui-ollama
```

## Step 9. Next steps

Try downloading different models from the Ollama library at https://ollama.com/library.

You can monitor GPU and memory usage through the DGX Dashboard available in NVIDIA Sync as you try different models.

If Open WebUI reports an update is available, you can update the container image by running:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

## Setup Open WebUI on Remote Spark with NVIDIA Sync

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't already installed NVIDIA Sync, [learn how here.](/spark/connect-to-your-spark/sync)

## Step 1. Configure Docker permissions

To easily manage containers using NVIDIA Sync, you must be able to run Docker commands without sudo. 

Open the Terminal app from NVIDIA Sync to start an interactive SSH session and test Docker access. In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

If you see a permission denied error (something like `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`), add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Test Docker access again. In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Step 2. Verify Docker setup and pull container

Open a new Terminal app from NVIDIA Sync and pull the Open WebUI container image with integrated Ollama on your DGX Spark:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

Once the container image is downloaded, continue to setup NVIDIA Sync.

## Step 3. Open NVIDIA Sync Settings

- Click on the NVIDIA Sync icon in your system tray or taskbar to open the main application window.
- Click the gear icon in the top right corner to open the Settings window.
- Click on the "Custom" tab to access Custom Ports configuration.

## Step 4. Add Open WebUI custom port configuration

Setting up a new Custom port will XXXX

Click the "Add New" button on the Custom tab.

Fill out the form with these values:

**Name**: Open WebUI

**Port**: 12000

**Auto open in browser at the following path**: Check this checkbox

**Start Script**: Copy and paste this entire script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

NAME="open-webui"
IMAGE="ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama"

cleanup() {
  echo "Signal received; stopping ${NAME}..."
  docker stop "${NAME}" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  exit 0
}
trap cleanup INT TERM HUP QUIT EXIT

## Ensure Docker CLI and daemon are available
if ! docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Error: Docker daemon not reachable." >&2
  exit 1
fi

## Already running?
if [ -n "$(docker ps -q --filter "name=^${NAME}$" --filter "status=running")" ]; then
  echo "Container ${NAME} is already running."
else
#  # Exists but stopped? Start it.
  if [ -n "$(docker ps -aq --filter "name=^${NAME}$")" ]; then
    echo "Starting existing container ${NAME}..."
    docker start "${NAME}" >/dev/null
  else
#    # Not present: create and start it.
    echo "Creating and starting ${NAME}..."
    docker run -d -p 12000:8080 --gpus=all \
      -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
      -v open-webui-ollama:/root/.ollama \
      --name "${NAME}" "${IMAGE}" >/dev/null
  fi
fi

echo "Running. Press Ctrl+C to stop ${NAME}."
## Keep the script alive until a signal arrives
while :; do sleep 86400; done
```

Click the "Add" button to save configuration to your DGX Spark.

## Step 5. Launch Open WebUI

Click on the NVIDIA Sync icon in your system tray or taskbar to open the main application window.

Under the "Custom" section, click on "Open WebUI".

Your default web browser should automatically open to the Open WebUI interface at `http://localhost:12000`.

> [!TIP]
> On first run, Open WebUI downloads models. This can delay server start and cause the page to fail to load in your browser. Simply wait and refresh the page.
> On future launches it will open quickly.

## Step 6. Create administrator account

To start using Open WebUI you must create an initial administrator account. This is a local account that you will use to access the Open WebUI interface.

In the Open WebUI interface, click the "Get Started" button at the bottom of the screen.

Fill out the administrator account creation form with your preferred credentials.

Click the registration button to create your account and access the main interface.

## Step 7. Download and configure a model

Next, download a language model with Ollama and configure it for use in
Open WebUI. This download happens on your DGX Spark device and may take several minutes.

Click on the "Select a model" dropdown in the top left corner of the Open WebUI interface.

Type `gpt-oss:20b` in the search field.

Click the `Pull "gpt-oss:20b" from Ollama.com` button that appears.

Wait for the model download to complete. You can monitor progress in the interface.

Once complete, select "gpt-oss:20b" from the model dropdown.

## Step 8. Test the model

In the chat textarea at the bottom of the Open WebUI interface, enter:

```
Write me a haiku about GPUs
```

Press Enter to send the message and wait for the model's response.

## Step 9. Stop the Open WebUI 

When you are finished with your session and want to stop the Open WebUI server and reclaim resources, close the Open WebUI from NVIDIA Sync.

Click on the NVIDIA Sync icon in your system tray or taskbar to open the main application window.

Under the "Custom" section, click the `x` icon on the right of the "Open WebUI" entry.

This will close the tunnel and stop the Open WebUI docker container.

> > [!NOTE]
> DGX Spark uses a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA), which enables dynamic memory sharing between the GPU and CPU. 
> With many applications still updating to take advantage of UMA, you may encounter memory issues even when within 
> the memory capacity of DGX Spark. If that happens, manually flush the buffer cache with:
```bash
sudo sh -c 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
```
