## Overview

## Basic idea

This walkthrough demonstrates how to set up and run an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
project using NVIDIA AI Workbench. You'll use AI Workbench to clone and run a pre-built agentic RAG
application that intelligently routes queries, evaluates responses for relevancy and hallucination, and
iterates through evaluation and generation cycles. The project uses a Gradio web interface and can work
with both NVIDIA-hosted API endpoints or self-hosted models.

## What you'll accomplish

You'll have a fully functional agentic RAG application running in NVIDIA AI Workbench with a web
interface where you can submit queries and receive intelligent responses. The system will demonstrate
advanced RAG capabilities including query routing, response evaluation, and iterative refinement,
giving you hands-on experience with both AI Workbench's development environment and sophisticated RAG
architectures.

## What to know before starting

- Basic familiarity with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) concepts
- Understanding of API keys and how to generate them
- Comfort working with web applications and browser interfaces
- Basic understanding of containerized development environments

## Prerequisites

- DGX Spark system with NVIDIA AI Workbench installed or ready to install
- Free NVIDIA API key: Generate at [NGC API Keys](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys)
- Free Tavily API key: Generate at [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
- Internet connection for cloning repositories and accessing APIs
- Web browser for accessing the Gradio interface

## Verification commands

- Verify the NVIDIA AI Workbench application exists on your DGX Spark system
- Verify your API keys are valid and up-to-date


## Time & risk

* **Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes (including AI Workbench installation if needed)
* **Risk level:** Low - Uses pre-built containers and established APIs
* **Rollback:** Simply delete the cloned project from AI Workbench to remove all components. No system changes are made outside the AI Workbench environment.

## Instructions

## Step 1. Install NVIDIA AI Workbench

This step installs AI Workbench on your DGX Spark system and completes the initial setup wizard.

On your DGX Spark system, open the **NVIDIA AI Workbench** application and click **Begin Installation**.

1. The installation wizard will prompt for authentication
2. Wait for the automated install to complete (several minutes)
3. Click "Let's Get Started" when installation finishes

**Troubleshooting installation issues**

If you encounter the following error message, reboot your DGX system and then reopen NVIDIA AI Workbench:

"An error occurred ... container tool failed to reach ready state. try again: docker is not running"

## Step 2. Verify API key requirements

This step ensures you have the required API keys before proceeding with the project setup.

Verify you have both required API keys. Keep these keys safe!

* Tavily API Key: https://tavily.com/
* NVIDIA API Key: https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys 
* Ensure this key has ``Public API Endpoints`` permissions

Keep both keys available for the next step.

## Step 3. Clone the agentic RAG project

This step clones the pre-built agentic RAG project from GitHub into your AI Workbench environment.

From the AI Workbench landing page, select the **Local** location if not done so already, then click **Clone Project** from the top right corner.

Paste this Git repository URL in the clone dialog: https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-agentic-rag

Click **Clone** to begin the clone and build process.

## Step 4. Configure project secrets

This step configures the API keys required for the agentic RAG application to function properly.

While the project builds, configure the API keys using the yellow warning banner that appears:

1. Click **Configure** in the yellow banner
2. Enter your ``NVIDIA_API_KEY``
3. Enter your ``TAVILY_API_KEY``
4. Save the configuration

Wait for the project build to complete before proceeding.

## Step 5. Launch the chat application

This step starts the web-based chat interface where you can interact with the agentic RAG system.

Navigate to **Environment** > **Project Container** > **Apps** > **Chat** and start the web application.

A browser window will open automatically and load with the Gradio chat interface.

## Step 6. Test the basic functionality

This step verifies the agentic RAG system is working by submitting a sample query.

In the chat application, click on or type a sample query such as: `How do I add an integration in the CLI?`

Wait for the agentic system to process and respond. The response, while general, should demonstrate intelligent routing and evaluation. 

## Step 7. Validate project

This step confirms the complete setup is working correctly by testing the core features.

Verify the following components are functioning:

```bash
✓ Web application loads without errors
✓ Sample queries return responses
✓ No API authentication errors appear
✓ The agentic reasoning process is visible in the interface under "Monitor"
```

## Step 8. Complete optional quickstart

This step demonstrates advanced features by uploading data, retrieving context, and testing custom queries.

**Substep A: Upload sample dataset**
Complete the in-app quickstart instructions to upload the sample dataset and test improved RAG-based responses.

**Substep B: Test custom dataset (optional)**
Upload a custom dataset, adjust the Router prompt, and submit custom queries to test customization.

## Step 10. Cleanup and rollback

This step explains how to remove the project if needed and what changes were made to your system.

> [!WARNING]
> This will permanently delete the project and all associated data.

To remove the project completely:

1. In AI Workbench, click on the three dots next to a project
2. Select "Delete Project"
3. Confirm deletion when prompted

**Rollback notes:** All changes are contained within AI Workbench. No system-level modifications were made outside the AI Workbench environment.

## Step 11. Next steps

This step provides guidance on further exploration and development with the agentic RAG system.

Explore advanced features:

* Modify component prompts in the project code
* Upload different documents to test routing and customization
* Experiment with different query types and complexity levels
* Review the agentic reasoning logs in the "Monitor" tab to understand decision-making

Consider customizing the Gradio UI or integrating the agentic RAG components into your own projects.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Tavily API Error | Internet connection or DNS issues | Wait and retry query |
| 401 Unauthorized | Wrong or malformed API key | Replace key in Project Secrets and restart |
| 403 Unauthorized | API key lacks permissions | Generate new key with proper access |
| Agentic loop timeout | Complex query exceeding time limit | Try simpler query or retry |
